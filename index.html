                    In week 1 my group has mostly just been ideating and researching about what OCBC is, what a bank does, what features does online banking provide. 
                    We have also been thinking about the needs of the target audience of the project and how we can enhance the experience of the application for these people.

                    We spent the second week developing on our ideas using diagrams and wireframes. This is so that we can find holes in our logic and find the problems
                    in the system early on instead of having to cancel features because it causes interference with other features. We have also been talking about
                    which OCBC online banking application to base our application off of to give us the best chance of developing an excellent app.

                    This week, we started building the foundation of our application such as the models, the sql database, the controllers and the views. We put in placeholders
                    to mark out what pages will be for what functions. We also started testing the facial recognition and the chatbot technology and figuring out how we could
                    integrate it with out application.

                <p>
                    We have finished testing the chatbot and successfully implimented a way to allow the user to upload a medical certificate in pdf form and display it for the staff 
                    to approve it. We decided to focus on the chatbot, the pdf upload, the signin and login and the facial recognition to be done by the hackathon so that we can showcase
                    these features.

                <p>
                    To get ready to present the prototype, we worked on connecting the backend to the frontend by making sure that the features we wanted to show were displayed 
                    in a simple way so that the judges would be able to understand what the features were doing. We also made sure that there was a flow to our application by adding in buttons
                    that go to difference pages in the web application and made sure that we did not have to type in the address of the page when demonstrating the application
